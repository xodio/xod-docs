# Accumulator

![Screenshot of 208-accumulator](./208-accumulator.patch.png)

Let's make a device which helps us in adding numbers. We will learn how to memorize values and update them.

The XOD standard library contains a `buffer` node which memorizes the input value when it receives a pulse.

To make some calculations and apply them to a stored value we should make a loop from the buffer output to the calculations and back to the buffer input.

To avoid limitless calculations and make it possible to reset the buffer we need a `select` node. It feeds the calculation result to the `buffer` node on a pulse.

In this example we're using the `add` node, but the calculation may be arbitrary complex.

## Exercise

Examine how the input value and pulses affect the stored result.

1.  Upload the program.
2.  Change the `tweak-number` value.
3.  Send pulse from the "ADD" node.
4.  Repeat the second and third steps a few times.
5.  Send pulse from "RESET".

Replace tweak nodes with a coin acceptor and button to make a ticket system or photo booth.
