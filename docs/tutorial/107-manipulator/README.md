# Manipulator

![Screenshot of 107-manipulator](./107-manipulator.patch.png)

Controlling the servo with a potentiometer or another analog sensor is easy. However, what if we want to make some complex movements with servos?

On the patch board, you see `servo-device`. This node defines a servo for the further usage: the port, minimum, and maximum pulse widths which correspond to the operating limits of the servo.

The `servo-device` node links to nodes that work with servos: `rotate-slow` in this example. The `rotate-slow` node rotates the servo to the angle specified in `VAL` with the `RATE` speed when a `DO` pulse is received. You may chain these nodes to make a sequential movement.

You may notice that `rotate-slow` have `MUX` pins. It's another custom type called `mutex` that allows only one node to act at the same time.

This program rotates the servo to the maximum angle slowly and then turn it back twice as fast on a button press. The button is ignored until rotation completes.

Upload the program and check it out.

## Circuit

## Exercise

Let's change the servo trajectory.

1.  Add two more `rotate-slow` nodes.
2.  Link all nodes in the same way.
3.  Adjust pin values of `rotate-slow`.
4.  Upload the program.

Press the button and see how the servo fulfills your order.

## üëÜ Simple nodes vs device nodes

The `xod-dev/servo` library also contains a `rotate` node. The main difference between it and `rotate-slow` that it rotates the servo immediately ignoring `MUX`.

And if you wonder how the simple `servo` node used in the previous chapter works: under the hood, it is a trivial composition of `servo-device` and `rotate` with a few terminals exposed to you. Simple nodes (also known as quickstart nodes) are enough for basic applications and when you need more, you use raw device nodes along with action nodes like you do in this chapter.

This idiom is applicable to other hardware as well.
