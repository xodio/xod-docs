# Units of Measure

![Screenshot of 211-units-of-measure](./211-units-of-measure.patch.png)

The standard `xod/units` library contains a few nodes for converting some popular units. For example, Celsius to Fahrenheit, degrees to radians and so on.

One of these nodes (`c-to-f`) is already on the patch and the program shows temperature in Fahrenheit.

## Exercise

Let's improve the program to see a temperature in Fahrenheit only when the button is pressed.

1.  Add `if-else` below `button`.
2.  Link `PRS` with `COND`.
3.  Link `Tc` with `F`.
4.  Link output from `c-to-f` with `T`.
5.  Link `R` with the second pin of `concat`.
6.  Upload the program.

Great! However, we still get a "C" on the LCD, even when the temperature converted to the Fahrenheit. Let's fix it.

1.  Add one more `if-else`.
2.  Link `PRS` to the new `COND` pin.
3.  Bind `"F"` to the `T` pin, and `"C"` to the `F` pin.
4.  Link `R` with the latest pin of the `concat` node.
5.  Upload the program again.

## üëÜ Remember the quotes

As was mentioned, the `if-else` node can work with numbers _and_ strings depending on the incoming value type. The `"F"` and `"C"` values you bind have to be put in quotes so that XOD knows what data type do you mean.

See the [generic nodes guide](https://xod.io/docs/guide/generics/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial) for better understanding.
