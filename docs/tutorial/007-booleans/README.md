# Booleans

![Screenshot of 007-booleans](./007-booleans.patch.png)

In previous lessons we mostly dealt with numbers adjusting counter step and clock interval. Now let's talk about _booleans_. They have only who possible values:

- _True_ (aka logic one, high signal)
- _False_ (aka logic zero, low signal)

Booleans are extremely useful and common. They may be used to indicate whether some condition is met, should a device be on or off, did some operation succeed, etc.

## Exercise

Let‚Äôs learn how boolean values can be combined.

1.  Read the descriptions for `and`, `or` and `not` nodes.
2.  Guess what the output value of `and` will be.
3.  Run the simulation to confirm it.
4.  Use `tweak-boolean` nodes to change it to the opposite value.

Check out descriptions for `nand`, `nor` and `xor` nodes. Add them onto the patch along with some additional tweaks to make a more complex processing.

## üëÜ Ladder logic

If one would use binary sensors like buttons or mechanic switches as a source of boolean values and relays instead of watches, he can use XOD to program PLC devices resembling the ladder programming which is common in industrial applications.
