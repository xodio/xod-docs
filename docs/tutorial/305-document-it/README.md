# Adding Documentation

![Screenshot of 305-document-it](./305-document-it.patch.png)

The only thing our node lacks is proper documentation. The pins are unlabeled and the help panel does not describe what it does at all. Let's fix that.

## Instructions

Apply the instructions to your `between` node.

1.  Using Inspector add descriptions to the terminal nodes. They will become pin descriptions in the help panel.
2.  Click on any empty space on the patch to see the Inspector for the whole patch.
3.  Add the description for the whole patch. It will become the node's description for the node in the help panel.
4.  Invoke the help box to see how the documentation renders.
