# Variadic Nodes

![Screenshot of 008-variadics](./008-variadics.patch.png)

Check out the `or` node on this patch. In the previous lesson we saw that it has just two inputs, but now it has four! That's because some of the nodes in XOD are _variadic_ — you can change their number of inputs.

Variadic nodes can be recognized by the handle on the right side. Also, their pins are marked as “variadic” in the help panels.

## Exercise

Let’s learn how to adjust the number of inputs.

1.  Hover over the right side of the `add` node. Your cursor should become a double arrow.
2.  Click and drag to the right to add more inputs.
3.  Use the new inputs to link the “11” `tweak-number`, bind some values to others.

As you guess, `add` will sum all the inputs it got. Run the simulation to verify.
