# Getting Help

![Screenshot of 006-help](./006-help.patch.png)

By now you should be a bit bored by the `clock` and `counter`. XOD offers many more nodes to work with and yet more [nodes are shared by the community](https://xod.io/libs/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial) members. What a node does is described with a short annotation carried with the node. Your discovery starts with reading these descriptions.

## Exercise

Let's learn a few ways to see nodes‚Äô descriptions.

1.  Scroll to the `xod/math` section in the Project Browser and click to expand it.
2.  Click on the `clip` patch, and then press the H key. A help box with the description will appear.
3.  Click on another patch. Help panel will move and show a description for it.
4.  Select some node on the patch board and press the H key. Quick Help panel will appear at the right side of the patch board.

Discover a few more nodes bundled within the XOD standard library.

## üëÜ Help while searching

As you probably noticed from previous lessons, the help boxes also automatically appear when using Suggester.

## Extra exercise

Using all the knowledge you have up to this moment, try to make a program which shows a cosine of a continuously increasing angle. Math is beautiful!
