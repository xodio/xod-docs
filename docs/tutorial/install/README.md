# Installing and Running XOD

To work with XOD, you use the XOD integrated development environment (IDE for short), which comes in two flavors: browser-based and desktop version.

## Browser-based IDE

You can start the [browser-based XOD IDE](/ide/) simply by visiting the link. However, because the browser has relatively few permissions to access the computer’s file system and USB-ports, its capabilities are quite limited.

Notably, you can’t upload your program directly to the board from within your browser and you won't get the convenient save/load functionality.

However, you can import/export your programs as a single file (known as a xodball), generate source code that you could copy and paste into an Arduino IDE, and then upload it to the board via the Arduino IDE.

## Desktop IDE

XOD IDE for desktop requires installing, but provides all features. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Find a distribution package for your system on [downloads page](/downloads/).

## What’s next

Once you start XOD IDE, you’ll see the `welcome-to-xod` project open. It’s a tutorial project split on many small lessons. Follow instuctions in its comments to learn XOD. There is a [web version of the tutorial](../01-hello/) if you just want to get shallow understanding.

You’ll need some hardware components to compete the tutorial, here is the [list of parts](../required-hardware/).
