# Tweaks

![Screenshot of 005-tweaks](./005-tweaks.patch.png)

Restarting a program every time you change a value in the Inspector is inconvenient. With `tweak-*` nodes, you can adjust values while the program is running.

On the current patch we added a `tweak-number` linked to `IVAL` already.

## Exercise

Let‚Äôs learn how to add new tweaks to your program and control them in runtime.

1.  Add `tweak-number` node to the patch.
2.  Link `tweak-number`'s output pin to `count`'s `STEP` pin.
3.  Start the simulation.
4.  Double click the tweak node; the text box for tweak value will focus in Inspector.
5.  Change the value to `2.0` and press Enter.
6.  Adjust the value of the tweak linked to `clock`'s `IVAL` pin.

Take a note how the changes are immediately applied while you are in the simulation mode. Try some other values and see how they behave.

## üëÜ Save some typing

Use Up/Down keyboard keys in the Inspector to adjust numeric values by 0.1. Hold Shift to adjust by 1.0.
