# Complex Projects

In the tutorial's past chapters, you’ve used a bare minimum of nodes to build simple projects. But what if you need to create something more complex?

The programming principles stay the same even if you create more patches and use more nodes.

## Search for nodes

Before implementing your own nodes, check if there is a ready to use node that will solve your problem. Visit [library index](/libs/) to browse for existing nodes.

## Interfacing with hardware

If you want to use a sensor or an electronic module that you haven’t found support for, it’s quite possible that all you need is a few standard nodes like `analog-read` or `digital-write`.

Refer to the item's documentation to understand how you can talk with the hardware.

## Write a native wrapper

You can implement new nodes not only in XOD, but also with C++. You can even wrap an existing native library to make it available in XOD.

See the implementation of `analog-read`, `digital-write`, and `text-lcd-16x2` for examples of how to do this.

## Tell us what you need

The XOD ecosystem is barebones since the project is very-very young. If you need a node for something, [ask for it on our forum](//forum.xod.io). That will help us better prioritize our work.

## Dive into details

Read the [User’s guide](/docs/#users-guide) to understand XOD better.
