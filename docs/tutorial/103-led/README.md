# LED Node

![Screenshot of 103-led](./103-led.patch.png)

You already made a blinking LED and controlled it in the interactive session. But you have only feed it with the values of true and false. The false value auto-converts to 0 and represents no glow at all, whereas the true value converts to 1 and denotes the full brightness.

You can also set an intermediate brightness level by setting values _between_ 0 and 1.

## Exercise

Let‚Äôs fine-tune LED brightness.

1.  Assemble a circuit according to the [scheme](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/103-led/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit), and connect the board to your computer.

2.  Set the value of the `PORT` pin to `D11`. Leading "D" means that it's a digital port.

3.  Replace the `tweak-boolean` node with `tweak-number`.

4.  Upload the program with the interactive session enabled.

5.  Change the value of `tweak-number` in the range from 0 to 1 and see how the brightness of the LED changes.

## üëÜ PWM feature

An LED can change the brightness only if connected to a board pin which supports PWM. If you have an Arduino board, find out the port number with the leading "~" symbol.

Many board models have no PWM on D13, so we wire the LED to another pin.
