# Ambient Light Sensor

![Screenshot of 110-ldr](./110-ldr.patch.png)

Let’s introduce a new sensor to measure the ambient light level. A photoresistor (aka light dependent resistor or LDR) will do a great job of measuring the parameter. However, there is a small problem: we do not have a photoresistor node in XOD.

We have basic nodes for working with digital and analog ports though. The photoresistor is a pretty primitive device, and all we need to do is read its value from the analog port. To do so, use an `analog-sensor` node.

## Circuit

## Exercise

Let’s make a smart (or dumb) light bulb.

1.  Assemble the [circuit with an LDR and LED](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/110-ldr/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit).

2.  Link the `VAL` output pin of the `analog-sensor` node to the `LUM` pin of the `led` node.

3.  Upload the patch to the board.

Cover the photoresistor with your hand and watch how the brightness of the LED changes.
