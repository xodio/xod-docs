# Strings

![Screenshot of 012-strings](./012-strings.patch.png)

Another important data type is a _string_. Strings represent pieces of text like ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù or "[https://xod.io](https://xod.io/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial)". XOD depicts the string type in yellow.

Tweak nodes for strings are a bit special. For optimisation purposes XOD needs to know the maximum length of the tweaked string, so there are several ones available. When you want to add a string tweak, choose the smallest one necessary.

The standard library contains a few nodes to work with strings and text. One useful node is `concat`. It joins several parts into a single one. This allows creating a message out of several data sources.

## Exercise

Try strings in runtime.

1.  Run the Simulation.
2.  Observe how the message alternates between "Hello World" and "Hello XOD".
3.  Change values of `tweak-string-16`s to change the message.
4.  Add a third pin to `concat` and bind an exclamation point to it.

## üëÜ Generics

Note, the `if-else` node can work with numbers _or_ strings depending on the incoming value type. The pins which accept various types are called _generic_. You can spot them by the little dot in the center.

If you want to bind a string value to a generic pin, you should enquote it because the number `3.14` and the string `"3.14"` are different things. The quotes explicitly tell XOD you‚Äôve meant a string value.
