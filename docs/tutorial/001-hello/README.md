# Welcome to XOD, Maker!

![Screenshot of 001-hello](./001-hello.patch.png)

In XOD, we do not use text to code; we use visual objects instead.

This large gray area with boxes is your program. It's called a _patch_. Patches are like documents or source files in other systems.

Several related patches form a _project_. Currently you are working on a project named `welcome-to-xod`.

## Exercise

Letâ€™s learn how to navigate a project.

1.  On the left-hand side, you will find a list of patches grouped by a project or library name. The list is called a _Project Browser_. The first item in it is `welcome-to-xod`. Expand the project by clicking on it.

2.  As you can see, the tutorial consists of many patches. Right now, you are in the patch `001-hello`. The next chapter of the tutorial is in the patch `002-simulate`. Double-click it, and let's meet there!

## ðŸ‘† Web hints

If anything goes wrong or you have no idea what to do, we have [hints for every patch](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/001-hello/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial) on the web.
