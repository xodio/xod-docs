# Thermometer

![Screenshot of 109-thermometer](./109-thermometer.patch.png)

What if you need to control the ambient air temperature?

A popular chip to measure temperature is TMP36 thermometer. XOD has a node `thermometer-tmp36` for this IC in `xod/common-hardware`. It outputs the temperature in degrees Celsius.

## Circuit

## Exercise

Showing static text on the LCD is boring. So let's make a smarter device and show the temperature on the LCD.

1.  Add a thermometer to your [circuit as shown](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/109-thermometer/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit).

2.  Ensure the correct `PORT` for the `thermometer-tmp36` node.

3.  Link `Tc` of `thermometer-tmp36` with `L1` of `text-lcd-i2c-16x2`.

4.  Upload your patch.

Now you have a portable thermometer.

## üëÜ Output formatting

You can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using `xod/units/c-to-f` node.

Moreover, you can add a `concat` node and show the temperature on the display like "22C" instead of a plain number. See `210-string-formatting` for more details.
