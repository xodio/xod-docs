This is a web-version of a tutorial chapter embedded right into the XOD IDE.
To get a better learning experience we recommend to install the

# Running Simulation

![Screenshot of 002-simulate](./002-simulate.patch.png)

Eventually, you will want deploy to some real hardware. But for the start, XOD also offers a simulation mode that allows running a program right inside the IDE.

It's useful to quickly test some ideas or just play around.

## Exercise

Let's learn how to run our program!

1.  Hit Deploy → Simulate from the main menu.
2.  Observe how your current patch opens in a special “Debugger” tab, and the `watch` node becomes alive demonstrating the current counter value.
3.  To finish the simulation session press the “Stop” button in the upper right corner or close the debugger tab.

## 👆 Shortcut

Use the button with a _gamepad_ icon on the deployment pane to run the simulation with a single click. The deployment pane is at the bottom of the IDE window.
