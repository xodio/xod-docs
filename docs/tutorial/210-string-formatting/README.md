# String Formatting

![Screenshot of 210-string-formatting](./210-string-formatting.patch.png)

Here is a program with a text LCD that shows the temperature. We already formatted the thermometers output to get a human readable string on the LCD like "Temp: 14.3C".

The `format-number` node transforms the number value to a string with a desired precision.

The `concat` node concatenates a three parts of the string that we want to see on the display.

To show non-ASCII characters you should specify its hexadecimal character code in the special "\x" notation. Codes differ on various LCD models. For example, if you have an MT-16S2H, the degree character is "\x99". Check out character tables for your model in its datasheet.

## Instructions

Let's improve the thermometer to show the degree character on the LCD.

1.  Bind 2 to `DIG`.
2.  Add one more input pin for the `concat` node by grabbing the handle.
3.  Bind "\x99" instead of "C".
4.  Bind "C" to the latest pin of `concat`.
5.  Upload the program.
