# Buses

![Screenshot of 207-buses](./207-buses.patch.png)

It's time to learn how to keep the program clean and get rid of link intersections.

You can see triangle nodes on the patch. These nodes are called _buses_.

It's an alternative way to link nodes' pins. They create ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù links. There are two node types in `xod/patch-nodes` that work in tandem:

- `to-bus` ‚Äî defines a new bus

- `from-bus` ‚Äî sources data from an existing bus

Bus nodes with the same label are considered to be implicitly interconnected by XOD. You can make a few `from-bus` nodes with the same label.

## Exercise

Link the `IVAL` pin with the counter output using bus nodes.

1.  First of all, we'll make a loop. So place a `defer` node.
2.  Place `to-bus`.
3.  Label it "IVAL".
4.  Link these nodes.
5.  Click on the `IVAL` pin of the `clock` node and the press the "B" key on your keyboard. The label automatically sets from the linking pin label.
6.  Upload the program.

## üëÜ Shortcut

Another fast way to create a bus is from an existing link. Select a link and press "B". XOD breaks the link and adds bus nodes instead.
