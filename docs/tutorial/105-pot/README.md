# Potentiometer

![Screenshot of 105-pot](./105-pot.patch.png)

The potentiometer reads an analog value from the hardware port and outputs a normalized result in the range from `0.0` to `1.0`, depending on the angle of the knob.

It brings an easy solution to control LEDs, servos, and system coefficients.

## Exercise

Let's control the brightness of the LED with a potentiometer.

1.  Connect a potentiometer to the Arduino board according to the [scheme](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/105-pot/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit).

2.  Set the `PORT` pin value on the `pot` node to `A0` because it’s connected to the analog board port A0.

3.  Link the `pot` node `VAL` pin to the `LUM` pin on the `led` node.

4.  Upload your patch.

Rotate the knob and see how the LED reacts to it. Cool, eh?
