# Slow Down

![Screenshot of 209-slow-down](./209-slow-down.patch.png)

You often see the "Loop" value bound to `UPD` pins.

"Loop" (also known as "Continuously") means that XOD tries to pulse these nodes as fast as it can. These nodes evaluate themselves on each transaction.

Sometimes it's excessive and may lead to slowing the program performance. Especially if you're working with sensors that depend on timing like an ultrasonic range meter.

To avoid this, you can replace the "Continuously" with another source that pulses with the desired interval or only when necessary. For example, a `clock` node.

## Exercise

Make the temperature display less sporadic.

1.  Place a `clock` node.
2.  Link it with the `UPD` pin of the `thermometer-tmp36` node.
3.  Upload the program.

Heat and cool down the thermometer and observe the incremental changes of the data shown.
