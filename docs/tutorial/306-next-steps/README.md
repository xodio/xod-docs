# Next Steps

What you've just learned about making nodes is totally sufficient for day-to-day xoding.

If you are interested in a more in-depth guide on creating nodes, check out the [docs on xod.io](https://xod.io/docs/guide/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#making-your-own-nodes). There you will learn about creating nodes in C++, testing them using tabtests and wrapping existing Arduino libraries.
