This is a web-version of a tutorial chapter embedded right into the XOD IDE.
To get a better learning experience we recommend to install the

<a href="/ide/">browser-based IDE</a>, and you’ll see the same tutorial there.

# Working with Hardware

In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to upload programs to your Arduino (or compatible) controller board and work with hardware modules.

To upload programs to Arduino, you need to [install the desktop version](https://xod.io/downloads/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial) of XOD. The browser version does not have enough permissions to access USB ports. Nevertheless, you can upload XOD programs even from the browser version if you have the original Arduino IDE installed by copying and pasting the generated code.

If you have no hardware on hand, don’t give up. Skip to the `200-patterns` part and go on replacing hardware nodes with `watch`es and `tweak`s.
