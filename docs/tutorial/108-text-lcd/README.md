# Display Text on LCD

![Screenshot of 108-text-lcd](./108-text-lcd.patch.png)

There are many variants of liquid crystal displays (LCD). Among them, text displays are simplest to communicate with. A text LCD can expose either of physical interfaces:

- I2C
- Parallel

XOD supports both.

## Exercise

Let‚Äôs show some text on an LCD.

1.  Examine your LCD and decide which node fits it. Remove another one.
2.  Assemble the [circuit](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/108-text-lcd/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit) that matches your LCD model.
3.  Bind pins or set the I2C address.
4.  Bind "Wuzzup!" to the `L1` pin.
5.  Link `tweak-string` with `L2`.
6.  Upload the patch with the interactive session enabled.
7.  Select `tweak-string`.
8.  Type some text and press the Enter key.

## üëÜ Too many variations

The world of text LCDs is too wide to guess your LCD pinout and parameters. The provided circuit will work for some models, but not for others. Refer to your particular display documentation to precisely determine its address, data pinout, contrast pin wiring, digital and backlight powering scheme.

For the rest of the tutorial we assume you have an I¬≤C LCD listening on 27h address. Adjust patches accordingly if you‚Äôve got another model.
