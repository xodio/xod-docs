# Buttons

![Screenshot of 104-button](./104-button.patch.png)

Here is a `button` node from `xod/common-hardware`.

Take a look at button outputs. It has a `PRS` pin, which is true whenever it is pressed. And `DONE` pin, which pulses when reading is done, wherever the button is pressed or not.

This is a standard idiom for side-effect nodes representing hardware or, for example, the Internet.

## Circuit

## Exercise

Let's make the LED glow while the button is pressed.

1.  Assemble the [circuit with a button and LED](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/104-button/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit).
2.  Set the `PORT` value of the `button` node.
3.  Link `PRS` to `LUM`.
4.  Upload your patch.

Hold the button to turn the LED on.

## Additional exercise

Place the already familiar node `flip-flop` between `button` and `led` to switch the LED on or off on each press.
