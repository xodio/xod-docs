# Pulses

![Screenshot of 009-pulses](./009-pulses.patch.png)

In previous lessons, we told that the `clock` node ticks. To be more precise, the node outputs _pulses_.

This data type is very different from all the others like numbers and booleans. Values ​​in the XOD are transferred to the links continuously, even if they don’t change. They are like voltage. The pulse data type is different. Imagine something like a flash. It’s basically a message to trigger something else. It does not transmit any data. Howerver, it is useful when you need to convey that an event has occurred or tell something else to work.

And of course, XOD offers a `tweak-pulse` node to send pulses manually during simulation.

## Exercice

Let’s play with pulses using `tweak-pulse`.

1.  Run the simulation.
2.  Select the `tweak-pulse` node.
3.  Press the “pulse” button in the Inspector; the counter will reset back to 0.
4.  Replace the `clock` node with an another `tweak-pulse` and restart the simulation.
5.  Increment the counter by manually sending pulses to `INC` pin.
