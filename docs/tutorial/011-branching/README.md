Choosing between values based on some condition is a common task. For this, there is an `if-else` node in `xod/core`.

The `COND` pin of this node checks the boolean input value. If `COND` receives true, the node sets the value from the `T` pin to the `R` pin. When it receives false, it sets the value from the `F` pin to the `R` pin.

## Exercise

Learn how `if-else` behaves.

1.  Run the simulation.
2.  Change the value of the `tweak-boolean` node, observe how `if-else` output chenges.
3.  Replace `tweak-boolean` with a `flop-flop` with `TGL` pin connected to a `clock`.
