# Loops

![Screenshot of 205-loops](./205-loops.patch.png)

Let's make a simple traffic light. Each light is activated by the `delay` node. When the latest one finishes it sends a pulse to the begining and our traffic light starts over.

To make the loop we need a special `defer` node. When `defer` node receives some value or pulse it postpones downstream nodes evaluation until the next transaction.

The `defer` node is always required when you make a loop to avoid deadlocks. For now, you can remember to place `defer` nodes right in the places where you want to complete a feedback loop. Read the guide to better understand the [execution model](https://xod.io/docs/guide/execution-model/#feedback-loops-handling?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial).

Program begins with the initial `boot` pulse. Then each delay node triggers the next one. The latest one pulses back to the beginning, and it works continuously.

## Exercise

Let's bring the button back and make the device start with the button press.

1.  Assemble a circuit according to the [scheme](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/205-loops/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial#circuit).
2.  Replace `boot` with the `button` node and bind the corresponding `PORT` value.
3.  Link with a free pin of the `any` node.
4.  Upload the program.

Press the button to run the chain.
