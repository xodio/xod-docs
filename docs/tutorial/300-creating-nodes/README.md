# Creating Your Own Nodes

In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to create your own XOD nodes.

We will take an existing patch and _extract_ a part of it into a separate node with a few input pins to control its parameters.

Then we will add labels and descriptions that will be displayed in the help panel for our node, just like for the XOD standard library.
