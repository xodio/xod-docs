# Linking Rules

To make XOD programs behave predictably, there are some rules on how pins can be
linked.

## Outputs and inputs

You’re not allowed to link two input pins, nor are you allowed to link two
output pins. It doesn’t make much sense.

A link must always connect an output and an input.

If you want to mirror values, just create multiple links from an output pin.

An output can have an arbitrary number of links, but an input can have no more
than one incoming link.

## Type matching

If an input and an output have the same [data type](../data-types/), they may be
linked as is.

However, if they have different types, they can only be linked if the output
type can be [cast](/docs/reference/data-types/#casting-rules) into the input
type.

Once you start linking, pins that are suitable for the other end of the link are
highlighted.
