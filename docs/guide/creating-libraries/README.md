# Creating Libraries

This article will guide you through the process of creating and publishing your own library.

## Starting a library

Here's a little secret: libraries and [projects](../projects/) in XOD have no technical difference. The distinction is conventional. Your project becomes a library when you decide that it is.

To start a new library, hit “File → New Project.”

## Crafting nodes

[Make the nodes](/docs/guides/#making-own-nodes) you want to be in the library like you would do for any project.

[Documenting the nodes](../documenting-nodes/) you're going to share is extremely important for libraries. A lack of short descriptions for nodes and their pins will very likely ruin your effort and make the library unusable to others.

## Adding example patches

The obvious step is to test your nodes in action before sharing them. One of the possible ways to do so is by creating several _example patches_. They are regular patches with a conventional `-example` suffix in their name like `mcp3002-adc-example`.

On such patch, place the node to be tested and use the most basic input/output facilities: watches, constants, LEDs, pots, and buttons. Having done that, you focus on the node under the test. Upload the patch to verify that the node works as expected. Later, any xoder can view and upload the same example as well to learn how the node works.

## Setting metadata

To publish a library, you are required to set several project-level fields. All of them are accessible through the “Edit → Project Preferences” dialog.

<table class="ui definition table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>
        The library will be available to others under the
        <code>yourusername/name</code> full name. Use a short and descriptive
        name under 20 characters.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>License</td>
      <td>
        OSS license name defining terms of use for your work. Choose between
        MIT, BSD, GPL, etc.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Version</td>
      <td>
        The <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">semver</a> tag for
        the upcoming publication. If you're about to publish a library for the
        first time, as a rule of thumb, start with <code>1.0.0</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>
        One- or two-tweet-long description for your library. It is shown on <a
        href="https://xod.io/libs/">https://xod.io/libs/</a> and inside XOD
        IDE.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Publish

When ready, hit “File → Publish Library.” Review the proposed effects and click “Publish.”

A few seconds later, your new library will be available at the [Libraries](/libs/) section on the XOD site. Feel free to announce your treasure to [XOD community](https://forum.xod.io).

## Using own library

To use a library you've published already in any other project, think of it as of a third-party library. That is, hit “File → Add Library” and [install](../using-libraries/#installing-a-library) own library, just like anyone else would do.

## Updating

If you have published a larger-than-trivial library, you will likely want to release an update for it sooner or later. To do so:

1.  Open the library project.
2.  Make the required changes.
3.  Update the metadata.
4.  Publish again.

A special note on updating the version field: You are not allowed to re-publish the same version as any you have posted before. The version number must be _bumped_. The best practice is to follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) convention:

- increment the last number (1.3.1 → 1.3.2) if you're just fixing bugs or improving the documentation;
- increment the middle number (1.3.1 → 1.4.0) if you're releasing new features preserving backward compatibility – i.e., you are adding new features, not changing existing ones; and
- increment the first number (1.3.1 → 2.0.0) if you have made breaking changes.

Once the new version is published, to make it visible to your other projects, update the local installation of your own library by hitting “File → Add Library” again.
