# Controlling LEDs via UART — Exchanging Text-based Data Between Two Boards

![UART communication](./uart-example.jpg)

This example describes how to exchange data between two Arduino boards.

For the data source, we will use two potentiometers connected to the first Arduino board. We will serialize the data into formatted text lines and send them via UART to the second Arduino board. The second Arduino Board will control the brightness of two LEDs using the obtained data.

## Required hardware

- 2 × Arduino Uno board
- 2 × LED
- 2 × 220 Ω resistor
- 2 × 10 kΩ potentiometer
- 2 breadboards
- hook-up wires

## Circuits

### Sender board

![Sender board](./arduino-pots.jpg)

The first step is to make the circuit for the Arduino board which sends data. Connect two potentiometers to the `A0` and `A1` analog ports on the Arduino board.

### Receiver board

The second step is to make the circuit for the Arduino board which receives data. Connect two LED through the 220 ohm resistors to the `D4` and `D6` digital ports on the Arduino board.

To control the brightness, both LEDs should be connected to ports which support [PWM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation).

### Link Arduino boards

The third step is to create a UART connection between the Arduino boards. All Arduino boards have at least one UART interface also known as _hardware_ serial or just “serial”.

To communicate the serial interface uses two pins named `TX` and `RX`. `TX` and `RX` are abbreviations for Transmit and Receive, respectively.

For example, Arduino Uno has one serial interface on digital pins `D0` (`RX`) and `D1` (`TX`). On Uno, this port is also used to communicate with the computer via USB. In turn, Arduino Mega has three additional UART interfaces:

- `Serial1` on pins `D19` (`RX`) and `D18` (`TX`)
- `Serial2` on pins `D17` (`RX`) and `D16` (`TX`)
- `Serial3` on pins `D15` (`RX`) and `D14` (`TX`)

If the hardware serial interfaces are insufficient, a UART interface can be simulated on any Arduino digital pins programmatically. The technique is known as bit-banging and such interface is called _software_ serial

![Linking boards circuit](./uart-bus.fz.png)

In this tutorial, the Arduino Uno boards which have only one UART interface It’s busy because we use it to load the firmware and communicate with the computer. So, let’s create a new software serial.

Define digital pins `TX` and `RX` on both Arduino boards. Let the `D8` Arduino pin be `RX` and the `D9` Arduino pin be `TX`.

To link two devices with a UART bus, the `TX` pin of the first device should be connected to the `RX` pin of the second device, while the `TX` pin of the second device should be connected to the `RX` pin of the first. This can be done physically by overlapping the wires.

Link the `D9` pin on the first Arduino board with the `D8` pin on the second Arduino and `D9` pin on the second Arduino board with the `D8` pin on the first board.

All signals require a reference voltage. The `GND` is what provides this reference for single-ended signals such as those used by a UART. Therefore the grounds on both boards should be joined.

Link the `GND` pin on the first Arduino board with the `GND` pin on the second board.

## Programming

Create a new project in XOD and name it something like `uart-led-control`. We will create two XOD patches — one for each board. Create a new patch for the potentiometers connected board and name it `pots`.

<div class="ui segment note">
<span class="ui ribbon label">Note</span>

For this project, some nodes are contained in a library [`gabbapeople/uart-led-control`](https://xod.io/libs/gabbapeople/uart-led-control/). Be sure to [add it into your workspace](/docs/guide/using-libraries/). The nodes from this library will be included in the XOD standard library soon

### Get values

Let's gather the values from the potentiometers and prepare them for the later serialization.

![Pots patch step 1](./pots.step1.patch.png)

- Add two [`pot`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/common-hardware/pot/) nodes onto the patch. They correspond to a couple of potentiometers on the breadboard. To avoid confusion, label them differently. For example, `pot A` and `pot B`.
- Set the `PORT` pins of the `pot` nodes. As we connected them to `A0` and `A1`, we set the `PORT` pin values to `A0` and `A1`.
- A `pot` node outputs the signal values in the range from `0` to `1`. A potentiometer is an analog electronic component. Even if you don’t touch the potentiometer knob, the `pot` output value can continuously change for example from `0.855` to `0.856` and back. To get rid of these minor changes let’s round the potentiometers outputs to two decimal places after the dot.
- Add two `round-fraction` nodes onto the patch and link them with `pot` nodes. To set two decimal places after the dot, place the `2` value to the `DIG` pin.

### Assemble data

In this guide, we use the [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (Comma-separated values) text-based format to form string lines with the data we transmit. Each line is a [String](/docs/guide/data-types/#string-type) of two signal values from potentiometers separated by a comma.

Here is an example of the string: `0.25,0.95`.

![Pots patch step 2](./pots.step2.patch.png)

To combine all data values to a single string, use the [`join`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/core/join/) node.

- Place `join` onto the patch.
- Set the delimiter value at the `D` pin to `,`.
- Link the `join` node with both `round-fraction` nodes.

### Send data

Let’s define the software serial interface in the `pots` program and describe how the data is transferred.

![Pots patch step 3](./pots.step3.patch.png)

- To set up the software serial interface put the [`soft-uart`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/uart/soft-uart/) node from the `xod/uart` library onto the patch. Set the `RX` and `TX` pin values. We put the `D8` value to the `RX` pin and the `D9` value to the `TX`.
- The `BAUD` pin sets the data rate in bits per second (baud) for serial communication. These baud values are standardized. For the software serial interface, the maximum baud value is `115200`. Note that the higher the baud value, the greater the chance that a data may get lost or broken during the transmission. We set the `BAUD` value to `19200`.
- Add the [`print`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/uart/print/) node from the `xod/uart` library into the patch. This node transforms a string value from the `DATA` pin into a single line by adding two bytes with a carriage return `\r` and line feed `\n` byte literals. After this `print` sends the line via UART each time the pulse signal comes on its `SEND` pin.
- Link the `DATA` pin with the `join` node.
- Link the `UART` pin of the `print` node with the `soft-uart` node.

Here is an example of the line to be sent: `0.25,0.95\r\n`.

### Limit frequency

The last step for the `pots` patch is to limit the sending frequency. We will send a new line only when any of the potentiometer values changes.

Also we are going to use a `throttle` node to slow down the pulse frequency. During the turn, a potentiometer generates lots of new values and the pulse rate is high. It is desirable to limit the pulse frequency so that each line has time to be sent in integrity.

![Pots patch](./pots.patch.png)

- Add two [`pulse-on-change`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/core/pulse-on-change/) nodes onto the patch and link them with the `round-fraction` nodes.
- Put the [`any`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/core/any/) node onto the patch and link its inputs with the `pulse-on-change` nodes. Now, the `any` and `pulse-on change` nodes will generate a pulse if the potentiometer value is changed.
- Add the `throttle` node onto the patch and place it between `any` and `print` nodes. `throttle` passes a pulse through no more than once every `T` seconds. To slow down the frequency we place the `0.05` seconds value to the `T` pin.

The patch for the first Arduino board is done. Upload, use a terminal emulator to observe the result. Let’s make the next patch.

### Receive data

The program for the Arduino board with LEDs starts with receiving data from UART. Create a new patch for the LEDs connected board and name it `leds`.

![LEDS patch step 1](./leds.step1.patch.png)

- To set up the software serial interface put the [`soft-uart`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/uart/soft-uart/) node from the `xod/uart` library onto the patch. Set `RX` and `TX` pin values. We put the `D8` value to the `RX` pin and the `D9` value to the `TX`.
- Arduino boards must communicate at the same speed. The `BAUD` pin value is the same as on the previous patch. Put the `19200` value to the `BAUD` pin.
- Add the `read-line` onto the patch. This node listens to the UART interface for the stream of bytes. If it is available, the `read-line` node searches the `\n` byte literal in it and dumps all the characters before the `\n` to a single line. It also cuts the `\r` byte literal from the output. The `READ` pin triggers a new read of a line.
- Link the `UART` pin of the `read-line` node with the `soft-uart` node and set the `READ` value to `Continuously`.

### Parse data

When a line is received it has to be parsed. We will use the `parse-tabular` node to parse the serialized CSV line back into two numbers.

![LEDS patch step 2](./leds.step2.patch.png)

- Add two `parse-tabular` nodes onto the patch. One node per an LED. The `parse-tabular` node is inverse to `join`. It splits a string `STR` into tokens using `D` as a delimiter and outputs the token at index `IDX`. The `IDX` numbering starts at `0`. For example, for the line `ABCD,1234,EFGH` with the `,` delimiter, the part with the `0` number is `ABCD`, the part with the `1` number is `1234`, and the part with the `2` number is `EFGH`.
- Link the `STR` pins of the `parse-tabular` nodes with the `LINE` pin of the `read-line` node.
- Set the delimiter at the `D` pins. Specify it as a character in single quotation marks.
- Set the `IDX` value of the first `parse-tabular` node to `0` to read the `Pot A` value.
- Set the `IDX` value of the second `parse-tabular` node to `1` to read the `Pot B` value.

### Control LEDs

To complete the `leds` patch, it remains to send the line parts to the LEDs.

![LEDS patch](./leds.patch.png)

- Put two `parse-number` nodes from the `uart-example` library to the patch and link them with the `parse-tabular` nodes. The `parse-number` node converts values from the [String](/docs/guide/data-types/#string-type) type to [Number](/docs/guide/data-types/#number-type).
- Add to [`led`](https://xod.io/libs/xod/common-hardware/led/) nodes for each potentiometer. You can name them `LED A` and `LED B` as the potentiometers. As we connect LEDs to the `D3` and `D6` pins on the Arduino board, we put `D3` and `D6` values to the `PORT` pins of the `led` nodes.
- Link the `parse-number` outputs with the `LUM` pins of the `led` nodes.

Both patches are done, you can upload them to their boards.
